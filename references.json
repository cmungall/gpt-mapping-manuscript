    "abstract": "In this paper, a new perspective is suggested for unsupervised Ontology Matching (OM) or Ontology Alignment (OA) by treating it as a translation task. Ontologies are represented as graphs, and the translation is performed from a node in the source ontology graph to a path in the target ontology graph. The proposed framework, Truveta Mapper (TM), leverages a multi-task sequence-to-sequence transformer model to perform alignment across multiple ontologies in a zero-shot, unified and end-to-end manner. Multi-tasking enables the model to implicitly learn the relationship between different ontologies via transfer-learning without requiring any explicit cross-ontology manually labeled data. This also enables the formulated framework to outperform existing solutions for both runtime latency and alignment quality. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned only on publicly available text corpus and inner-ontologies data. The proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, Edit-Similarity, LogMap, AML, BERTMap, and the recently presented new OM frameworks in Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI22), offers log-linear complexity in contrast to quadratic in the existing end-to-end methods, and overall makes the OM task efficient and more straightforward without much post-processing involving mapping extension or mapping repair.",
