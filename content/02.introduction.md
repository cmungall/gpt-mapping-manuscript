## Introduction

The unification of diverse knowledge bases, lexicons, and ontologies necessitates the interrelation or mapping of entities. An instance of this process can be seen when merging multiple disease terminologies, where it's crucial to ascertain the equivalence of a disease concept across different vocabularies. This challenge is commonly referred to as the ontology matching problem.

The procedure of ontology matching generally employs a combination of automated processes and human intervention. The automated part usually comprises lexical matches of labels, synonyms, or other vocabulary components. This strategy can yield high recall; however, due to lexical ambiguities and homonyms, its precision may suffer depending on the sources. Consequently, a manual filtration step, usually undertaken by a domain expert, is often mandated. Nonetheless, this final filtration phase can prove laborious, as lexical methods typically generate an abundance of potential mappings.

Our team has developed a method that conducts automatic filtration and categorization of prospective mappings using large language models. We approach this as an in-context learning challenge where the model is presented with assorted concept pairs, accompanied by the correct elucidation of their relationship.

We subsequently put this methodology to the test on an anatomy ontology matching task.
