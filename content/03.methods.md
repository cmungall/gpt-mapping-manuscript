## Methods

### GPT-based mapping agent

We generate a prompt according to the following template:
    
{% raw %}
```
What is the relationship between the two specified concepts?

Give your answer in the form:

category: <one of: EXACT_MATCH, BROADER_THAN, NARROWER_THAN, RELATED_TO, DIFFERENT>
confidence: <one of: LOW, HIGH, MEDIUM>
similarities: <semicolon-separated list of similarities>
differences: <semicolon-separated list of differences>

Make use of all provided information, including the concept names, definitions, and relationships.

Examples:

{{ examples }}

Here are the two concepts:

{{ describe(conceptA) }}
{{ describe(conceptB) }}
```
{% endraw %}

We use a few-shot learning approach. Examples are provided in-context in the following form:

```
[Concept A]
id: FOO:125
name: wing
def: part of a bird that is flapped to enable flight
is_a: Limb
relationship: part_of Bird
relationship: has_part Feather

[Concept B]
id: BAR:458
name: wing
relationship: part_of Aeroplane

category: DIFFERENT
confidence: HIGH
similarities: function
differences: A is an anatomical part; B is a part of a vehicle
```

For each candidate mapping between concepts A and B, we generate a description of each concept,
incorporating key elements: name, synonyms, definition, relationships. 

The prompt is then passed to a GPT model, which generates a response. The response is parsed to retrieve
the key data model elements: category, confidence, similarities, differences.

### Example

As an example, two concepts from the fruitfly and zebrafish anatomy ontologies are candidate matches
due to sharing a lexical element (abbreviation). This is a false positive match in reality,
as the concept are entirely different.

The two concept descriptions are generated from respective ontologies as follows:

```yaml
[Concept A]
id: FBbt:00001906
name: embryonic/larval Malpighian tubule Type I cell
def: Type I cell of the embryonic/larval Malpighian tubules.
synonyms:  PC ;  embryonic/larval Malpighian tubule Type I cell ;  larval Malpighian tubule Type I cell ;  larval Malpighian tubule principal cell ; 
is_a:  embryonic/larval specialized Malpighian tubule cell ;  Malpighian tubule Type I cell ; 

[Concept B]
id: ZFA:0000320
name: caudal commissure
def: Diencephalic tract which is located in the vicinity of the dorsal diencephalon and mesencephalon and connects the pretectal nuclei. From Neuroanatomy of the Zebrafish Brain.
synonyms:  PC ;  caudal commissure ;  posterior commissure ; 
is_a:  diencephalic white matter ; 
relationship: part of synencephalon
relationship: start stage unknown
relationship: end stage adult
```

The payload for this using gpt-3.5-turbo is:

```yaml
category: DIFFERENT
confidence: HIGH
similarities: NONE
differences: A is a type of cell in the embryonic/larval Malpighian tubules; B is a diencephalic tract in the zebrafish brain.
subject: FBbt:00001906
object: ZFA:0000320
```

This is then parsed to a YAML object:

```yaml
predicate: DIFFERENT
confidence: HIGH
similarities:
  - NONE
differences:
  - A is a type of cell in the embryonic/larval Malpighian tubules
  - B is a diencephalic tract in the zebrafish brain.
```

### Implementation

We use the OAK library to binding to ontologies.

the overall framework is implemented in OntoGPT.

### Evaluation

We evaluate against LogMap, which is one of the top-performing mappers in the OAEI.

We convert LogMap results to SSSOM [doi@10.1093/database/baac035]. (Harshad to write)

To generate anatomy test sets, we generated pairwise mappings between species-specific anatomy ontologies,
using the Uberon and CL mappings as the gold standard. i.e. if a pair of concepts are transitively linked
via Uberon or CL, then they are considered a match.

To evaluate against the gold standard we only considered "best" mappings from each method

LogMap produces a score with each mapping, so we scanned all scores to determine the optimal score threshold
in terms of accuracy (F1) (note this gives LogMap an advantage over our method, which does not produce a score).

For the MapperGPT method, we filtered any mapping that is not predicted to be EXACT.
