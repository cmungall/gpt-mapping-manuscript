## Discussion

Unlike traditional ontology mapping tools, MapperGPT can provide narrative explanations
of why two concepts are predicted to be related in a certain way.

### Future Work

We are planning to integrate MapperGPT into our Boomer pipeline to make BoomerGPT,
a hybrid neurosymbolic mapping tool that integrates probabilistic inference, description logic
reasoning, lexical methods, rule-based methods, and LLMs.
