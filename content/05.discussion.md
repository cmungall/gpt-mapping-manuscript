## Discussion

Unlike traditional ontology mapping tools, MapperGPT can provide narrative explanations
of why two concepts are predicted to be related in a certain way.

### Future Work

MapperGPT is expensive to run with GPT-4. We recommend its use in cases where simpler lexical methods
should suffice. We are exploring use of open models that can be executed locally.

We are planning to integrate MapperGPT into our Boomer pipeline to make BoomerGPT,
a hybrid neurosymbolic mapping tool that integrates probabilistic inference, description logic
reasoning, lexical methods, rule-based methods, and LLMs.
